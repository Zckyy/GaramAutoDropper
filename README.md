# Discord Self Bot - Auto Drop

A Discord self-bot that automatically responds to mentions from a specific bot by sending slash commands.

## Features

- üöÄ **Initial Drop**: Attempts a `/drop` command immediately on startup
- üëÅÔ∏è **Mention Detection**: Monitors for mentions from the [Garam bot](https://top.gg/bot/1061825343285112842)
- ‚ö° **Auto Response**: Automatically sends `/drop` commands when mentioned
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with timestamped logs

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd DiscordSelfBot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and fill in your values:
   - `CHANNEL_ID`: The Discord channel ID where commands will be sent
   - `BOT_ID`: The ID of the bot you want to interact with
   - `TOKEN`: Your Discord user token

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## How It Works

1. The bot connects to Discord using your user token
2. Immediately attempts a `/drop` command on startup
3. Listens for any mentions from the specified bot ID
4. When mentioned, automatically sends another `/drop` command
